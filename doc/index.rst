Welcome to py-wsse!
===================

`WS-Security`_ (SOAP WSSE) support for Python, including an optional `Suds`_
plugin.

.. _Suds: https://fedorahosted.org/suds/


Prerequisites
-------------

``py-wsse`` supports Python 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4.

``py-wsse`` depends on `PyOpenSSL`_, `python-xmlsec`_, and `lxml`_, which in turn rely
on C headers being available on your system for ``OpenSSL``, ``libxml2``, and
``libxmlsec1``.  On Debian/Ubuntu, ``sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev`` should take care of that. On RedHat-based systems,
try ``sudo yum install openssl-devel libxml2-devel xmlsec1-devel
xmlsec1-openssl-devel libtool-ltdl-devel``.

If using `Suds`_, the `jurko fork`_ is required; it contains required fixes to
the plugin API. (This fork is available on PyPI as the `suds-jurko`_ package.)

Installation
------------

``py-wsse`` is available on `PyPI`_. Install it with::

    pip install py-wsse

Or use ``pip install py-wsse[suds]`` to pull in `Suds`_ as an additional
dependency.

Features
--------

``py-wsse`` supports exactly what I needed and no more. If you need more, or
more flexibility, pull requests with tests and doc updates are welcome!
Current features:

* Signing a SOAP envelope ``Body`` and ``wsu:Timestamp`` security token using
  an X509 certificate and associated private key.

* Verifying WSSE signatures on a received SOAP envelope.

* Encrypting the contents of the SOAP ``Body`` using the recipient's X509
  certificate.

* Decrypting ``EncryptedData`` elements in a received SOAP envelope.

.. warning::

   Yes, `XML Encryption 1.0 is broken`_. Sometimes people use it anyway --
   require it, even -- and we have to talk to their systems, so here it
   is. Just don't assume it will actually protect your data. Use TLS.

Usage
-----

With Suds
~~~~~~~~~

To use with `Suds`_, just add an instance of ``wsse.suds.WssePlugin`` to the
list of ``plugins`` passed to a new ``Client`` instance::

    from suds.client import Client
    from suds.wsse import Security, Timestamp
    from wsse.suds import WssePlugin

    def get_client(our_keyfile_path, our_certfile_path, their_certfile_path):
        wsse = Security()
        wsse.tokens.append(Timestamp())

        return Client(
            wsdl_url,
            transport=transport,
            wsse=wsse,
            plugins=[
                WssePlugin(
                    keyfile=our_keyfile_path,
                    certfile=our_certfile_path,
                    their_certfile=their_certfile_path,
                ),
            ],
        )

``WssePlugin`` requires that the outgoing messages already have a
``wsse:Security`` element in the ``soap:Header`` with an optional
``wsu:Timestamp`` token. Suds can do this via its ``Security`` and
``Timestamp`` objects, as shown in the above example.

In the example, ``our_keyfile_path``, ``our_certfile_path``, and
``their_certfile_path`` should all be absolute filesystem paths to X509
certificates (or private key) in PEM format. The ``our`` cert and key are used
to sign outgoing messages and decrypt incoming messages. The ``their`` cert is
used to encrypt outgoing messages and verify the signature on incoming
messages.

Note that ``WssePlugin`` is currently hardcoded to sign the ``wsu:Timestamp``
(if it is present) and ``soap:Body`` elements, and to optionally encrypt only
the first child of the ``soap:Body`` element.
Pull requests to add more flexibility are welcome.


Standalone functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you aren't using `Suds`_ you can also use the encryption/decryption and
signing/verification capabilities of ``py-wsse`` directly. The functions are
``wsse.signing.sign``, ``wsse.signing.verify``, ``wsse.encryption.encrypt``,
and ``wsse.encryption.decrypt``. For usage details, see how they are used by
``wsse.suds.SigningPlugin`` (in which ``context.envelope`` and
``context.reply`` are strings containing XML documents) and/or see their
respective docstrings.
